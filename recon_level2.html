        <h1>Level 2: Footprinting Basics</h1>
        <p>
            Footprinting is one of the initial phases of ethical hacking where the hacker gathers detailed information
            about a target system, organization, or network. The goal of footprinting is to gain as much information as
            possible to understand how the target operates, identify weaknesses, and begin the process of penetration
            testing.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Footprinting?</h2>
        <p>
            Footprinting is the act of collecting information about a target system, such as domain names, IP addresses,
            organizational structure, employee details, etc. In this phase, hackers do not directly interact with the
            target system but gather data through external resources and services.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is Footprinting Important?</h2>
        <p>
            The primary goal of footprinting is to gather as much information as possible about the target without
            alerting the target. This information helps ethical hackers or attackers to plan further actions such as
            identifying potential vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and weaknesses.
        </p>

        <h2>Types of Footprinting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Active Footprinting:</strong> Involves interacting directly with the target to obtain
                information, such as querying DNS servers, scanning the network, or using social engineering.</li>
            <li><strong>Passive Footprinting:</strong> Involves collecting information without interacting directly with
                the target system. Examples include browsing publicly available data such as WHOIS databases, social
                media, company websites, and other public data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Footprinting Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            Here are some common techniques used for footprinting:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>DNS Interrogation:</strong> A Domain Name System (DNS) query reveals domain information,
                including subdomains and hostnames.</li>
            <li><strong>WHOIS Queries:</strong> WHOIS queries provide information about domain ownership, registration
                details, and contact information.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Scanning:</strong> Identifying open ports, services, and devices in the target network
                to understand its structure and security posture.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Media Analysis:</strong> Many organizations unknowingly disclose valuable information
                about their infrastructure, employees, and operations via social media platforms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reconnaissance Tools for Footprinting</h2>
        <p>
            Some of the tools commonly used during the footprinting phase include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>WHOIS Lookup Tools:</strong> Examples include WHOIS.net, DomainTools.</li>
            <li><strong>DNS Lookup Tools:</strong> Tools such as nslookup and Dig help query DNS servers to gather
                domain information.</li>
            <li><strong>Traceroute:</strong> A tool to map the network path to a target, showing the network route
                packets take to reach the destination.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Dorks:</strong> Special search queries that help uncover sensitive information exposed on
                the web.</li>
        </ul>
